# OOPS in C++

This repository contains all the C++ code I am learning while exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects(Classes-> blueprint, Objects -> real world entity)
- Access Modifier(public, private, protected)
- Encapsulation(wrapping up of data & member function in a single unit called class and encapsulation helps in data hiding)
- Constructors (speacial function/method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for initialization. -> Non-parameterized, Parameterized, Copy-constructor)
- this(speacial pointer in c++ that point to the current objects)
- Destructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Friend Functions
- Operator Overloading
- File Handling
- Templates

## Purpose

This repository's goal is to document and track my learning progress in OOP with C++. It serves as both a reference for me and a resource for others who are interested in learning these concepts.
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!

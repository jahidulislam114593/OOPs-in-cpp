# OOPS in C++

This repository contains all the C++ code I am learning while exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects (Class -> blueprint, Object -> real world entity)
- Access Modifier (public, private, protected)
- Encapsulation (wrapping up of data/attribute & member function in a single unit called class)
- Constructors (special method/function invoked automatically at the time of object creation. Used for initialization. Three types of constructor(Non-parameterized, Parameterized, Copy Constructor-> two type of Copy Constructor(Shallow Copy, Deep Copy)))
- this (this is a special pointer in c++ that point to the current objects)
- Destructor 
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Static-Keyword

## Purpose

This repository's goal is to document and track my learning progress in OOP with C++. It serves as both a reference for me and a resource for others who are interested in learning these concepts.
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
